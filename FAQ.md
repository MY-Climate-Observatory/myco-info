# Frequently Asked Questions

## The Organization and Community

**1. What is MYCO?**

MYCO is a non-profit data platform that aims to aggregate legacy and alternative climate data in Malaysia. We are a community of people who are passionate about helping each 
other to make an impact and promote the values of sustainability. We have come together as a community to explore the potential climate data presents to advancing social science
research, advising the policy process, and inspiring grassroots data-driven initiatives.

**2. What is the motivation behind starting MYCO?**

Climate change is the greatest crisis humankind will face. If there is something that the 2020 COVID pandemic has taught us, it would be the fact that communities need to be 
well-prepared for natural catastrophes. To do so, communities must have access to relevant data to inform their mitigation and adaptation strategies. Climate data in Malaysia, 
however, is rather disparate. Thus, MYCO aims to provide readily-available, research-grade data to support research and policy-making. 

**3. Who started MYCO and what prompted this initiative?**

MYCO was started during the 2020 COVID pandemic when a social science student wanted to find Malaysian climate data to complete her assignment. Xiandi was frustrated to see that 
the climate data in Malaysia, even on Malaysia's open data portal, is not readily usable. The initial point of action was just to share a cleaned dataset that could allow other 
people to use it straight away. Once the dataset was ready, Xiandi then wondered if this could be done for other data metrics? The idea then grew  the organization it is today.

**4. What type of organization MYCO is?**

MYCO positions itself as a non-profit organization because it believes in the philosophy of Data for Social Good. It is currently planning its entity registration with 
Malaysia's Registrar of Societies (ROS).

**5. How is MYCO funded?**

MYCO is currently in its incubation phase. Most of our operation is on Github and doesn't require funding yet. However, as we grow, we will be needing financial support for
data storage and other services. We will be actively seeking for funding once we successfully register ourselves as a legal entity.

## About the Data

**1. What kinds of data are stored on MYCO?**

MYCO currently focuses on legacy and alternative datasets in Malaysia. 

**2. Where can I find information about the metadata of the dataset?**

Under each metric's repo, a dedicated markdown will be prepared explaining the source of the data, the variables of the data, the data processing information, etc.

**3. How are the data licensed?**

In most cases, the data is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If it happens that a particular
data source do not allow their raw data to be shared, we will make that clear in relevant documentation.

**4. How long are data stored?**

Permanently, unless for some reason Github shuts down, then we would most likely relocate to somewhere else that allows us to continue sharing our platform.

**5. What guarantees the data accuracy?**

Unfortunately, as MYCO do not directly collect the data, we can't guarantee the accuracy of these data. We can, however, do our best to document the metadata and what we have 
done to the data.
